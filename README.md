=================

Simple ioBroker-Adapter for sawtooth-functionality:
* fadeout room light
* fadein water pump 


PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A VERY EARLY STATE OF DEVELOPMENT, USE OF YOUR OWN RISK

If this adapter is not available on the ioBroker-Admin-View, please use the following command to install it (from command-line on your ioBroker-Server):

```npm install https://github.com/fungus75/ioBroker.sawtooth/tarball/master/```

Or you can use the GitHub-Button (labeled: install from own URL) in the Adapter-View and enter this URL on the "other"-Tab. This can also be used to update to the current adapter-version:

```https://github.com/fungus75/ioBroker.sawtooth/tarball/master/```
(if this url does not work, use https://github.com/fungus75/ioBroker.sawtooth.git instead)


You can use the method to update the adapter to the most recent version.



After the installation the adapter should show up in the ioBroker-Admin-View.
